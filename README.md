# Market-Sentiment-Index
Codes related to the creation of Market Sentiment Index at the European Commission.

The Market Sentiment Index captures market expectations at sector level.
The idea behind this index is to construct an economic sentiment indicator, but rather being based on surveys, it will be based on actual forecasts made by brokers on companies. This is a key advantage. The usage of these brokersâ€™ forecasts provides a more robust and market-oriented foundation for the index. The relevance of this index hence is the fact that it is simply a statistical representation of the expectations of brokers on the largest firms in every sector. This index has not the ambition of representing the whole market for the sector, still it provides extremely useful information in a snapshot that clearly shows trend and expectations.  The data are collected from Refinitiv thorugh Python API
